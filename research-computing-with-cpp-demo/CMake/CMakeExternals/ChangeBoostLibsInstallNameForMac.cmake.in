# Scan the Boost install lib directory for *.dylib files and change their install names for mac
# On Mac OS X system each shared library usually has a install name which is the absolute path of the library.
# For some reasons boost libs do not contain the absolute path but just their name
# (e.g. "libboost_thread.dylib" should be named "<PATH_TO_LIB/libboost_thread.dylib>")

# Get all the shared libraries which are located in the Boost install lib directory
file(GLOB dylibFiles @BOOST_ROOT@/lib/*.dylib)

# For each shared library call the install_name_tool in order to change the install name of the according library
